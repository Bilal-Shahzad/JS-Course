//4 Ways to Declare a JavaScript Variable
// Using var, let, const, or nothing

// Variables are containers for storing data 
var x = 5;
var y = 6;
var z = x + y;
console.log (z)

// x, y, and z, are variables, declared with the var keyword
// they can be used the same way as the other varaible

// x, y, and z, are variables, declared with the let keyword
let x = 5;
let y = 6;
let z = x + y;

// x, y, and z, are undeclared variables:
x = 5;
y = 6;
z = x + y;


// x stores the value 5, y stores the value 6, z stores the value 11


// When to Use JavaScript var
// Always declare JavaScript variables with var,let, orv const.

//EX 1
const price1 = 5;
const price2 = 6;
let total = price1 + price2;


// The two variables price1 and price2 are declared with the const keyword.
// These are constant values and cannot be changed.
// The variable total is declared with the let keyword. SOmething that can be changed
